# You can convert from one type to another with the int(), float(), and complex() methods:

# x = 1    # int
# y = 2.8  # float
# z = 1j   # complex
# 
# #convert from int to float:
# a = float(x)
# 
# #convert from float to int:
# b = int(y)
# 
# #convert from int to complex:
# c = complex(x)
# 
# print(a)
# print(b)
# print(c)
# 
# print(type(a))
# print(type(b))
# print(type(c))
