'''Python *args

As in the above example we are not sure about the number of arguments that can be passed
to a function. Python has *args which allow us to pass the variable number of non keyword
arguments to function.

In the function, we should use an asterisk * before the parameter name to pass variable length arguments.
The arguments are passed as a tuple and these passed arguments make tuple inside the function
with same name as the parameter excluding asterisk *.'''

# Example 3: Using *args to pass the variable length arguments to the function

# def adder(*num):
#     sum = 0
#     
#     for n in num:
#         sum = sum + n
# 
#     print("Sum:",sum)
# 
# adder(3,5)
# adder(4,5,6,7)
# adder(1,2,3,5,6)

'''In the above program, we used *num as a parameter which allows us to pass variable length
argument list to the adder() function. Inside the function, we have a loop which adds the passed
argument and prints the result. We passed 3 different tuples with variable length as an argument
to the function.
'''

'''Python **kwargs

Python passes variable length non keyword argument to function using *args but we cannot use this
to pass keyword argument. For this problem Python has got a solution called **kwargs, it allows
us to pass the variable length of keyword arguments to the function.

In the function, we use the double asterisk ** before the parameter name to denote this type of
argument. The arguments are passed as a dictionary and these arguments make a dictionary inside
function with name same as the parameter excluding double asterisk **.'''

# Example 4: Using **kwargs to pass the variable keyword arguments to the function

def intro(**data):
    print("\nData type of argument:",type(data))

    for key, value in data.items():
        print("{} is {}".format(key,value))

intro(Firstname="Sita", Lastname="Sharma", Age=22, Phone=1234567890)
intro(Firstname="John", Lastname="Wood", Email="johnwood@nomail.com", Country="Wakanda", Age=25, Phone=9876543210)

# o/p :-

'''
In the above program, we have a function intro() with **data as a parameter.
We passed two dictionaries with variable argument length to the intro() function.
We have for loop inside intro() function which works on the data of passed
dictionary and prints the value of the dictionary.'''


'''
Things to Remember:
*args and **kwargs are special keyword which allows function to take variable length argument.
*args passes variable number of non-keyworded arguments list and on which operation of the list can be performed.
**kwargs passes variable number of keyword arguments dictionary to function on which operation of a dictionary can be performed.
*args and **kwargs make the function flexible.'''
