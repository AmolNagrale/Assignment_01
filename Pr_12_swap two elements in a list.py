#Python program to swap two elements in a list

'''Given a list in Python and provided the positions of the elements,
write a program to swap the two elements in the list.
Examples: 
 

Input : List = [23, 65, 19, 90], pos1 = 1, pos2 = 3
Output : [19, 65, 23, 90]

Input : List = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], pos1 = 2, pos2 = 5
Output : [1, 5, 3, 4, 2]'''

'''Approach #1: Simple swap, using comma assignment 
Since the positions of the elements are known, we can simply swap the positions of the elements.'''
 


# Python3 program to swap elements
# at given positions
 
# Swap function
def swapPositions(list, pos1, pos2):
     
    list[pos1], list[pos2] = list[pos2], list[pos1]
    return list
 
# Driver function
List = [23, 65, 19, 90]
pos1, pos2  = 1, 3
 
print(swapPositions(List, pos1-1, pos2-1))
Output: 
 

[19, 65, 23, 90]
  
Approach #2 : Using Inbuilt list.pop() function 
Pop the element at pos1 and store it in a variable. Similarly,
pop the element at pos2 and store it in another variable.
Now insert the two popped element at each otherâ€™s original position.
 


# Python3 program to swap elements at given positions
 
# Swap function
def swapPositions(list, pos1, pos2):
     
    # popping both the elements from list
    first_ele = list.pop(pos1)  
    second_ele = list.pop(pos2-1)
    
    # inserting in each others positions
    list.insert(pos1, second_ele) 
    list.insert(pos2, first_ele) 
     
    return list
 
# Driver function
List = [23, 65, 19, 90]
pos1, pos2  = 1, 3
 
print(swapPositions(List, pos1-1, pos2-1))

#===================================================================================
  
Approach #3 : Using tuple variable

'''Store the element at pos1 and pos2 as a pair in a tuple variable,
say get. Unpack those elements with pos2 and pos1 positions in
that list. Now, both the positions in that list are swapped.''' 
 


# Python3 program to swap elements at
# given positions
 
# Swap function
def swapPositions(list, pos1, pos2):
 
    # Storing the two elements
    # as a pair in a tuple variable get
    get = list[pos1], list[pos2]
      
    # unpacking those elements
    list[pos2], list[pos1] = get
      
    return list
 
# Driver Code
List = [23, 65, 19, 90]
 
pos1, pos2  = 1, 3
print(swapPositions(List, pos1-1, pos2-1))
